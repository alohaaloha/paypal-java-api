1. Create Keystore and Self-signed Certificate
Open command prompt and go to %JAVA_HOME%\bin. Use keytool to create JKS (Java KeyStore) format keystore and a self-signed certificate.

C:\jdk\bin>keytool -genkey -alias srccodes -keyalg RSA -keystore c:\tomcat7\conf\srccodes.jks
Enter keystore password:
Re-enter new password:
What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:  SrcCodes Dot Com
What is the name of your organizational unit?
  [Unknown]:  SrcCodes.com
What is the name of your organization?
  [Unknown]:  SrcCodes Pvt. Ltd.
What is the name of your City or Locality?
  [Unknown]:  Kolkata
What is the name of your State or Province?
  [Unknown]:  WB
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
  [Unknown]:  IN
Is CN=SrcCodes Dot Com, OU=SrcCodes.com, O=SrcCodes Pvt. Ltd., L=Kolkata, ST=WB, C=IN correct?
  [no]:  yes

Enter key password for <srccodes>
        (RETURN if same as keystore password):
Re-enter new password:
-keystore
Filepath (say "c:\tomcat7\conf\srccodes.jks") where keystore file will be generated.
keystore password
Password of the keystore to be used by Tomcat. If not provided, then default is "changeit".
key password
Password of the self-signed certificate generated in the keystore. If not provided, then it'll be same as keystore password.


2. Configure Tomcat
Open <tomcat-installation-directory>/conf/server.xml in a text editor.

Search for "Define a SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8443". Connector configuration will be commented there. Uncomment it.

<!-- Define a SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8443
     This connector uses the JSSE configuration, when using APR, the
     connector should be using the OpenSSL style configuration
     described in the APR documentation -->
<!--
<Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
           maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
           clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" />
-->
Provide keystoreFile, keystorePass and keyPass values as given in Step #1.

<Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
           maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
           clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"
           keystoreFile="conf/srccodes.jks"
           keystoreType="JKS"
           keystorePass="pass4keystore"
           keyPass="pass4key" />
